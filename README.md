# QIPV-Course-Project
An Image Processing Algorithm in MATLAB to detect plastic litter laying around the floor 

## AIM
An Image Processing Algorithm in MATLAB to:-
* Detemine certain objects in toilet background
* Input: Any image of toilet littered with certain objects
* Output: Draw a rectangle over the object and classify it as waste objects

## Pre-Requisites

- [] Find a Standard Algorithm
- [] Optimisation
- [] Testing
- [] Getting ready for live demonstration

## Progress
Author  |  Detailed Description
------  |  --------------------
Vyshnav K  | Tested a simple Algorithm using Edges. The results were fine, but its not applicable in all cases. This Algorithm can be extended under certain circumstances
Vyshnav K  | An algortihm which classify objects, due to the property of curvature boundaries. Under test. Lot more optimisation required
